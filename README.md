## Abstract

Drug metabolism stability is a critical component in drug development. Traditional prediction methods rely on experimental data and molecular properties but exhibit poor accuracy when handling complex molecular structures. This study designs two GNN-based metabolism stability prediction models that effectively utilize molecular graph structures to enhance prediction accuracy.

Model 1 uses Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) with multi-layer architecture and global pooling strategies to extract molecular structural features. Model 2 combines Transformer and convolutional techniques with TransformerConv layers and multi-head attention mechanisms to capture long-range molecular interactions and improve generalization capability.

Experimental results show that both models outperform traditional machine learning methods on key metrics such as AUC and AUPR. An interactive web interface has been developed for practical testing and application.

## Model Architectures
